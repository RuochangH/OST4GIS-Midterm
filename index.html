    <h1>Divvy Bike-share Station Hourly Departure Projection</h1>
      <div class="slide1">
        <div id="intro">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="intro">In  2013, the city of Chicago lauched
            <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com">Divvy bike share system</a>.
            As a new mode that facilitates short distance travels and transit rides,
            the system is popular across the town. However, the unbalanced bike flows hamper
            the operation and expansion of the system. On the one hand, it results in full
            or empty station frequently, downgrading the reliability of the system.
            On the other hand, bike reallocation, solution to this problem, is based on
            real-time activity, which is costy and lagging behind.</p>
          <p class="intro">While the unbalanced bike flow is inherented, pro-active reallocation has the potential
            to reduce the cost and reduce loss of customers. Therefore, this project is designed to
            build a OLS model to project the hourly departure for 147 stations near downtown Loop.</p>
          <hr></hr>
          <h2>Model Building</h2>
          <p>The model was built on 147 stations near downtown Chicago for the second week of June in 2017, because there
            are greater rebalancing demand due to the prominent commuting patterns in warm days. During model building
            process, candidate predictors are selected based on their explanatory power and the selection was finalized
            by model generalizability suggested by cross-validation</p>
          <p>Before start, take a look at the accumulated departures in each stations for a weekday</p>

      <h2>Observe Hourly Departure Difference Across Locations and Times</h2>
      <p>To build the predictive model for hourly departures, the biggest challenge is that the our dependent variables
          are highly spatial- and serial- correlated because demands are usually concentrated in certain time period and location.</p>

        <h2>Predictors: Station Area Predictor Exploration</h2>
        <p>Apart from the previously mentioned lag variables, the model also includes socio-economic and bike network
          characteristics of station areas, distance to and average ridership of nearest transit stations for each
          bike station, and time of depatures. They are all theoritically related to bike trip demand. </p>
        <p>This page takes a deeper look at station area variables, including employment and population density, median
          household income, bike lane length, and number of Transit Stations within station area. Station area is
          defined by 0.5-mile buffer around stations. The origional data comes from ACS census, and Chicago Open Data,
          and they are summarized and exported in ArcGIS through Spatial Join.</p>
