      <h1>Divvy Bike-share Station Hourly Departure Projection</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="intro">In  2013, the city of Chicago lauched <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com">Divvy bike share system</a>.
          As a new mode that facilitates short distance travels and transit rides,
          the system is popular across the town. However, the unbalanced bike flows hamper
          the operation and expansion of the system. On the one hand, it results in full
          or empty station frequently, downgrading the reliability of the system.
          On the other hand, bike reallocation, solution to this problem, is based on
          real-time activity, which is costy and lagging behind.</p>
        <p class="intro">While the unbalanced bike flow is inherented, pro-active reallocation has the potential
          to reduce the cost and reduce loss of customers. Therefore, this project is designed to
          build a OLS model to project the hourly departure for 147 stations near downtown Loop.</p>

        <h2>Predictors: Station Area Predictor Exploration</h2>
        <p>To build the predictive model for hourly departures, we included four type of varibles,
          namesly spatially-and-temporally lagged hourly depatures, socio-economic and bike network
          characteristics of station areas, distance to and average ridership of nearest transit stations
          for each bike station, and time of depatures. The last three types are all theoritically related
          to bike trip demand, and the first type, including historical depatures at the same station and
          neighboring station departures, are assumed to be similar to the dependent variable because
          demands are usually concentrated in certain time period and location. </p>
        <p>For purpose of illustration, this page mainly illustrate major station area properties, including
          employment and population density, median household income, bike lane length, and number of Transit Stations
          within station area. Station area is defined by 0.5-mile buffer around stations. The origional data comes from
          ACS census, and Chicago Open Data, and they are summarized and exported in ArcGIS through Spatial Join.</p>

        <h2>Predictors: Serial and Spatial Lag Variables</h2>
        <p>Our previous research suggests that there are promonent correlation among the hourly depatures of a station,
        the hourly departures a week ago in the same hour, and the hourly departures a week ago in the same hour at neares neighbor station</p>
